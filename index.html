							<h1>Personal Information</h1>

									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>My specific interest in IT is in programming languages. My interest started when i was around 10 years old and would program on the Commodore 64. I would buy games magazines and enter the code provided to create my own games. Apart from self learned programming i was also interested in the networking side of things. I worked for Telstra for 2 years maintaining Bigpond backend servers and also for host networks as a helpdesk operator.<br>
									<br>I choose RMIT as i needed a flexible timetable to fit in with my work and family commitments. I needed the option to study online as getting to a university for lectures would not be feasible.<br>
									<br>During my time at RMIT i'm hoping to acheive my bachelor to help improve my chances of landing a job past a helpdesk role. I wish to expand my knowledge with a deeper understanding of both programming languages and general IT queries. I'm confidient this knowledge can be built upon to gain a skill which is desirable in the current competitivie workplace.</p>

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38804310?searchrequesttoken=1b184ae4-0429-474c-840a-9328c6b26e65&type=standout"><br><a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/job.png" alt="" data-position="25% 25%" /></a><br>
										This position is about building development solutions for a business's data and web solutions using server and mobile based technologies. The job is appealing to me as it is about using new and emerging technologies which utilise both new and existing platforms. It also allows to myself to develop skills which can be useful in furthering my IT career. Working in a collobrative position with members of different fields will help promote positive development of skills.<br>
										<br>Required for this role is past experience in working with production ready full stack solutions. Knowledge in web compatible languages such as HTML and CSS3 is also needed. Build tools such as ReactJS, NodeJS, WebPack and other available programs used for programming is a major requirement. Vendor's who provide cloud services is needed such as AWS or GCP. Problem solving, as need in most IT jobs is highly regarded as are written and oral communication skills.<br>
										<br>In regards to the advertised position, i'm currently well versed in server side networking and internet operating protocols. I understand at a moderate level the logisitics of data packaging through a wired and mobile system. I also have developed problem solving abilities which help me understand the process of debugging, solving and repairing errors that can appear in a digitized system. Both my diploma of IT (networking) and past work experience help in this regard.<br>
										<br>My main plan is, of course, to complete my bachelor of IT as this will greatly help myself to educate in the more detailed intricies of computer systems. Before this is completed however and once i have gained enough confidence, i will create a smaller stack development of my own to demonstrate my learned abilites. Through this i will build, develop and problem solve to slowly expand both my stack and knowledge, all through an industry standard accepted by most employers.</p>

									<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
									<p>I belive the results of the test reaffirm my belief that i'm a slightly introverted and methodical person who analizes a problem before attempting to solve it. It also means i'm much more likely to learn something from attempting and participating in the activity than being told what to do. My ability to solve a problem in my mind is enhanced when i attempt to disassemble the solution into smaller parts rather than analazing the big picture.<br>
									<br>The results would show that i'm more productive when given a task to do rather than focusing on the task in its entirety. I'm less likely to communicate with other members on my team unless it directly involves my particular task.<br>
									<br>Taking these results into account, i would rather be a working member of the team rather than a delegator or leader. I'm less inclined to want to present team results orally and would prefer to allow a more extroverted member of the team to handle presentation.</p>
